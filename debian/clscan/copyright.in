License:
 The files in here are mostly copyright (C) Free Software Foundation, and
 are under assorted licenses.  Mostly, but not entirely, GPL.
 .
 Many modules are provided dual-license, either GPL or LGPL at your
 option.  The headers of files in the lib directory (e.g., lib/error.c)
 state GPL for convenience, since the bulk of current gnulib users are
 GPL'd programs.  But the files in the modules directory (e.g.,
 modules/error) state the true license of each file, and when you use
 'gnulib-tool --lgpl --import <modules>', gnulib-tool either rewrites
 the files to have an LGPL header as part of copying them from gnulib
 to your project directory, or fails because the modules you requested
 were not licensed under LGPL.
 .
 Some of the source files in lib/ have different licenses.  Also, the
 copy of maintain.texi in doc/ has a verbatim-copying license, and
 doc/standards.texi and make-stds.texi are GFDL.
 .
 Detailed copyright information follows, see debian/clscan/README
 in the gnulib source package for information on updating this.
