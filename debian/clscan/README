Updating debian/copyright after importing a new upstream
--------------------------------------------------------

From the root of the gnulib source tree:

1. Run debian/clscan/clscan --scan

2. Edit debian/clscan/new.txt and review/correct licensing and
   copyright info.

3. Run debian/clscan/clscan --merge

4. Check debian/copyright is ok.


new.txt format
--------------

Lines beginning with '#' are ignored.

Lines beginning 'File:' and 'Hash:' should be left undisturbed.
'Hash:' is used to record the (SHA-256) checksum of the first 15 lines
of the file, to detect changed copyright/license headers.

Lines beginning 'License:' and 'Copyright:' should be corrected where
appropriate to contain the correct info. Indented lines following the
'License:' line should contain the license boilerplate.

overrides in modules/
---------------------

Files in modules/ contain the true license of some files. These
overrides are applied during 'clscan --merge'. See modules/README
and modules/COPYING for more info.

clscan dependencies
-------------------

clscan depends on the perl modules Getopt::Long, Digest::SHA,
File::Find, File::Copy, and YAML::Any (which loads any YAML module
found on the system).
