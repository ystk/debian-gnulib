Gnulib module: ftello

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This function is missing on some platforms:
IRIX 5.3, OSF/1 4.0, Solaris 2.5.1, mingw.
@item
The declaration of @code{ftello} in @code{<stdio.h>} is not enabled by default
on some platforms: glibc 2.3.6.
@item
This function produces incorrect results after @code{putc} that followed a
@code{getc} call that reached EOF on some platforms:
Solaris 10.
@item
This function fails on seekable stdin, stdout, and stderr: cygwin <= 1.5.24.

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
On platforms where @code{off_t} is a 32-bit type, @code{ftello} does not work
correctly with files larger than 2 GB.  The fix is to use the
@code{AC_SYS_LARGEFILE} macro.
@item
This function produces incorrect results immediately after @code{fseek} on some
platforms:
HP-UX 11.
@item
@code{fflush}, @code{ftell}, @code{ftello}, @code{fgetpos} behave incorrectly
on input streams that are opened in @code{O_TEXT} mode and whose contents
contains Unix line terminators (LF), on some platforms: mingw.
@item
On platforms where @code{off_t} is a 64-bit type, but @code{fseeko} is
not present, stream operations on files larger than 2 GB silently do
the wrong thing.  This affects BSD/OS, which is mostly obsolete.
