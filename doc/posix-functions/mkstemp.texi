Gnulib module: mkstemp

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This function is missing on some platforms:
mingw.
@item
On some platforms (HP-UX 10.20, SunOS 4.1.4, Solaris 2.5.1), mkstemp has a silly
limit that it can create no more than 26 files from a given template.  On
OSF/1 4.0f, it can create only 32 files per process.

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
On platforms other than glibc 2.0.7 or newer, @code{mkstemp} can create a
world or group writable or readable file, if you haven't set the process
umask to 077.  This is a security risk.
